## Participant FAQ

- **What is the Hour of Code?**
  [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us) is a global movement reaching tens of millions of
  students in 180+ countries. Anyone, anywhere can organize an Hour of Code event. One-hour
  tutorials are available in over 45 languages. No experience needed. Ages 4 to 104.

- **When is the Hour of Code?**
  You can learn to program any time, but this Hour of Code event takes place December 10, 2016 from
  11:00AM until 3:00PM.

- **How long is the event?**
  Each exercise should take about one hour. You are free to do as many exercises as you like.

- **I don't have a laptop. Can I still participate?**
  Of course! We will have a limited number of loaner laptops available, so students without devices
  may be required to work in groups. Additionally, there are several exercises that don’t require a
  computer listed at https://code.org/learn under the “No computers or devices” label.


## Mentor FAQ

- **How should I prepare for the Hour of Code?**
  Please be comfortable enough with a few of the exercises at https://code.org/learn/ so that you
  can help the participants through any parts they get stuck on. Any languages are fine here, but
  we’ll be recommending Block programming, Python, and JavaScript at the event.

  We have a couple of shifts available, and you’re welcome to participate in any or all of them.
  Please arrive fifteen minutes prior to your shift and check in with the organizers at the front of
  the room.
